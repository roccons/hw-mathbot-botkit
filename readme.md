# Mathbot

Mathbot is a chatbot with which you can practice multiplication tables. Created for children, or adults too, to practice and master the tables
in a funny way.

The Mathbot is being created using [Botkit](https://botkit.ai/).

This is a basic and incomplete version of the bot. There is a unresolved error for some users
and you can test a single question. 

There is also a version more complete of this bot using Botpress: [https://github.com/roccons/hw-mathbot-botpress](https://github.com/roccons/hw-mathbot-botpress)
